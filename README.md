# blogAPI
Created my own API and used that API to create a simple blog website. This uses NodeJS, express, axios, ejs, and mongodb to develop the website. Since this does not use an external server it is run locally.

# Install
This uses node so install node and the frameworks that are used for it. 
Install nodejs and then run

    npm init -y
    npm i 

# How to Run
Connect to the mongodb database by authenticating username and password.
Run the server locally and the embedded JS file by running the following

    nodemon server.js
    nodemon index.js
